# Shiptrack

Shiptrack is an application where users can keep track of shipments coming their way. When receiving packages from various sources, it may be difficult to remember what to expect and when to expect it. This application allows users to monitor all incoming shipments, whether it be pre-orders, prizes, gifts, or online purchases, with a clean and minimal user experience. 

This application is currently a work in progress.
